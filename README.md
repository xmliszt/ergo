<h1><a href="https://xmliszt.github.io/ergo/">Try It Out! 传送门</a></h1>

## Run Locally

- Clone the repository
- Switch to `dev` branch
- `npm install && npm run serve`
- Follow instructions on your terminal / command prompt to access the local version

## Authentication

- By default, if you visit the web app the first time, you are accessing the **demo** version without the need to login. In **demo** version, all tasks, categories and shop items created are shared among all users who are using the **demo**. You won't have personal task manager to access. This is because the **demo** version is used to demonstrate all features of the web app, not meant for being your personal assistant.
- To get a personal task manager, please click the "google sign in" on the top right corner to sign in to your google account.

## Version 1.0 Notes

- First release of the web app. You can create your task, organize tasks into different categories, create your own categories, assign coin rewards for each task and coins will be credited to your account upon completion. You can then direct to the shop (top left corner) and create your own shop items for consumption. Assign coins as cost for each item and try spending your coins by "buying" one of the items created. Viola! You now have set up your personal task manager with reward system and it's time to practice self-discipline and get motivated to complete your tasks!

## Disclaimer

_érgo_ will only work if you practice self-discipline, meaning that you will set the coin rewards and item prices in reasonable number. Of course, you can abuse the system by setting max rewards and keep spending on items you wish to enjoy. However, this will make the assistant ineffective and you won't be motivated to complete more tasks you set for yourself.
